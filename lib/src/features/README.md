# Features

The 'features' folder contains all the features of the applications.
A feature can have sub-features and depends on another features.
Inside a feature, we organize the code in layers (data, views, etc.)

For the moment we only have two main features: the Game, and the Localization. If we had a leadboard, if would be another feature.
